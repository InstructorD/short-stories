                <h2>The Witch’s Daughter</h2>
                <h3>Louise Coley</h3>
                <div class="text">
                   <p>The King sat on his throne, legs swinging in the afternoon sun. The wilderness spread out before him — a boy’s paradise of twisting dirt tracks webbed with ancient tree roots, full of shady hollows and secret hideaways. Behind him, the copse thinned until it met the road that would take you back to the village, but before him was the arena of countless battles, the base camp of every perilous expedition, a land of untold adventure. And — for today at least — it was all his.</p>
                   <p>“Halt!” he shouted. “Who goes there?”</p> 
                   <p>The little girl looked up at the boy sat in the tree. Long before either of them had been born a storm had done its best to uproot it, but the tree was an obstinate one and it had refused to give up its claw-like grip on the earth. Now it was a twisted and gnarled thing, bent over like an old man. It was perfect for climbing and the thickest branch dipped in just the right place to form a seat directly above the path.</p>
                   <p>“It’s me. Who are you?”</p>
                   <p>“I’m the King, ain’t I?” The boy puffed up his chest in indignation. “Now — are you friend or foe?”</p>
                   <p>“Friend or foe?” the girl repeated.</p>
                   <p>“Yes,” said the King. It had seemed a straightforward enough question.</p>
                   <p>“That depends,” said the girl.</p>
                   <p>There was a rustling in the bushes behind them.</p>
                   <p>“What’s happening?” a voice said. A chorus of shushes drowned it out.</p>
                   <p>“No no no.” The King shook his head at the girl. “You’re s’posed to say friend.”</p>
                   <p>“But what if I say foe?”</p>
                   <p>“Well,” the King said, fearing that he was losing his grip of the situation, “in that case, everyone jumps out and chases you back to the river.”</p>
                   <p>There was a groan from the bush and a head popped out. The face was grubby and the hair was full of twigs.</p>
                   <p>“It ain’t an ambush if you tell them,” it managed to say before a hand reached up and pulled it back under.</p>
                   <p>“Silence, peasant!” the King shouted, certain at least that shouting things like that was still part of the game, even if other events were quickly running away from him. You had to assert your authority if you wanted to stay King for very long.</p>
                   <p>Appeased, the bushes were quiet once more.</p>
                   <p>“Alright then,” said the girl. “Friend.”</p>
                   <p>“Ah-ha!” the King declared, raising one finger to indicate that the girl had been got. “That’s exactly what a goblin would say!”</p>
                   <p>“Do I look like a goblin?”</p>
                   <p>“Well, uh.” The King floundered again. “No, not exactly. But that’s because goblins is the master of disguise, right?”</p>
                   <p>The bushes rustled in agreement.</p>
                   <p>“I take it that a goblin would also say that they weren’t, in fact, a goblin?”</p>
                   <p>“Exactly,” said the King, nodding sagely. This newcomer was catching on quickly.</p>
                   <p>“Oh dear,” said the girl, all big eyes and innocent expression. “Then it would seem that we are at an impasse.”</p>
                   <p>The King did not know big words and chose to ignore this.</p>
                   <p>“Whatever,” he huffed. “You can’t come past here till you prove you’re a good guy. I’m the King so you has to do as I says, and I says no dirty little goblins can come in the village. Even if they are little girls.”</p>
                   <p>A few more heads were popping up now, craning to see who was there and what the delay was. Generally, this game had less talking and more running around and screaming.</p>
                   <p>“Oi, Dylan! Knock it off!”</p>
                   <p>“That’s King Dylan, to you,” Dylan said, turning to face the dissenting bush dweller. It was his squire, otherwise known as Fred Carson, the butcher’s son.</p>
                   <p>“Just give it up, alright?” his friend said. “She’s not playing with us.”</p>
                   <p>“Why not?” Dylan turned back to the girl. “You want to play, right? You have to be a goblin though. Everyone’s a goblin, first time they play. You get to hiss at people and do cunning schemes, but you always lose in the end on account of being evil.”</p>
                   <p>“I’d like that,” the girl said.</p>
                   <p>“She’s not playing with us,” Fred growled.</p>
                   <p>Fred was bigger than the rest of them, older too. He may have been on the rotund side, but once he picked up enough momentum it was like having a steamroller after you, and whilst his fingers looked all the world like his father’s pork sausages, they made a mean fist. The children in the bushes glanced back and forth between the two of them, trying to pick a horse to back. There was a general shuffling in Fred’s direction. King Dylan suddenly felt very exposed.</p>
                   <p>“Why not?” Dylan asked nervously.</p>
                   <p>“My Dad says not to mix with folk like her,” said Fred. “She’s not one of us.”</p>
                   <p>“But I’m the King—”</p>
                   <p>But Fred wasn’t looking at him any more. He was looking at the girl.</p>
                   <p>“We aren’t playing, Dylan. It’s time for little witches to go back where they came from.”</p>
                   <p>The girl shrugged and turned around, starting her way back down the path. She didn’t look upset. That somehow made it worse, Dylan thought. Next moment he was falling out of the tree at Fred, yelling at the top of his lungs.</p>
                   <p>The onlookers weren’t quite sure what to do. Real fighting didn’t happen very often.</p>
                   <p>“Goblin king?” a bush voice suggested.</p>
                   <p>“Goblin king!” the cry became, and suddenly everyone had joined the skirmish.</p>
                   <p>Five minutes later, all squabbles outside of the game were forgotten. The goblins had infiltrated their ranks and there was no time for such trivial matters. It was a good game, although Dylan lost, of course.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>Her name was Ivy, he found out at school. She lived with her mother in a house on the outskirts of the village. They were not from around here, said Ben Hudson, the grocer's son. They were, it was widely agreed, Bad Sorts. They didn’t come to church any more, which was a telling sign said Lucy, one of the pastor's daughters, and it meant they were certainly heathens.</p>
                   <p>Ralph Hind, the pub landlord's youngest, said that heathens could do all sorts of black magic, and that Ivy’s mother must have used some black magic to make her husband disappear because no one knew who he was. Ivy, whispered Lily Evesham, the shopkeeper's daughter, didn’t have a father. Arthur Perkins didn’t have a father either, but that was different because he had been killed in a ploughing incident and had gone to live with Jesus. Ivy didn’t have a father because her mother was a witch and a hussy. Those were the words Fred Carson used, and his father was generally considered a reliable source of information. You learnt all sorts, slicing people’s bacon. Not that Ivy’s mother bought any. You couldn’t trust people who didn’t like bacon.</p>
                   <p>Dylan’s father told him not to go around asking those sort of questions and gave him a thick ear before bedtime. He was not to play with Ivy or talk about her Mother in this house again. They weren’t from around here.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>It was a few weeks before he saw her again. He was stood daydreaming in the shade, his back up against the rough bark of an oak tree. In the distance, he could hear the squeals and laughter of his friends causing chaos. He nearly jumped out of his skin as she sidled out from behind the tree.</p>
                   <p>"Good morning, my liege," she said.</p>
                   <p>"It's just squire today," he sighed. "Tom is King now."</p>
                   <p>Kings was getting boring. There were whispers that by next week they'd be back to playing pirates. They could steal old bits of wood and rope from their Dad's sheds and the flag from the market square and build a raft to sail down the river like last year, try and beat the record before it sank.</p>
                   <p>"And how goes the war with the goblins?"</p>
                   <p>"It's boooring," Dylan pouted. "I'm guarding our base, see? But we're thrashin' 'em so it's dead quiet here."</p>
                   <p>"This is your base?"</p>
                   <p>"Yeah." Dylan gestured at the small hollow in the ground behind him, half-hidden by the trees. "And that there's the scone of stone or somethin'. If you have that you win, so I’ve got to stop anyone pinching it."</p>
                   <p>“Oh,” she said, adjusting her satchel. “Only I like to come and sit here.”</p>
                   <p>They regarded each other dumbly. Dylan didn’t notice the unasked question floating in the air.</p>
                   <p>“What’s in the bag?” he asked, when the silence and her dark-eyed stare got too much for him.</p>
                   <p>“Books,” she said.</p>
                   <p>“Like... spellbooks?” Dylan shifted his weight slightly.</p>
                   <p>Ivy tilted her head to one side, face scrunching up as she gave this serious consideration.</p>
                   <p>“In a way,” she said. She gave nothing else away.</p>
                   <p>“Where are you from?” he asked.</p>
                   <p>She pointed back along the track towards the river.</p>
                   <p>“Up on the hill,” she told him.</p>
                   <p>“But there’s nothing past the river,” he said, brow furrowing.</p>
                   <p>“There is,” Ivy said. “There’s my house and Mr Lowe’s fields and Mr Digby’s flock and a few other families.”</p>
                   <p>“Nothing much,” he conceded, not about to be proven wrong about his own village.</p>
                   <p>
                    “The whole world’s beyond the river,” Ivy pointed out.</p>
                   <p>Dylan blinked. The village was the world, all the world that Dylan needed. It was easy to forget about the rest of it, the bits that only existed on maps in geography class or in adventure stories. Here was where all his friends were and where everyone knew who he was and said hello to him on the street. The rest of the world didn’t seem all that important.</p>
                   <p>“True,” he said. “And you... you’re from there?”</p>
                   <p>“From... the world?” she looked at him as though he had three heads. “No, I’m from the village. Same as you. Only,” she pointed again, “the other side of the bridge.”</p>
                   <p>“Just... they say you aren’t from around here. Were you born somewhere else?”</p>
                   <p>“Oh, yes,” she nodded as though she finally understood his question. “At the hospital.”</p>
                   <p>Dylan didn’t think that this was what they meant. He tried a different question.</p>
                   <p>“They say your Mum’s a witch,” he said, knowingly.</p>
                   <p>“Yes,” she replied.</p>
                   <p>“You mean...”</p>
                   <p>“They say that, yes.”</p>
                   <p>“Oh,” said Dylan. He hadn’t expected her to be so upfront about it. If his mum was a witch, he’d have kept it a secret.</p>
                   <p>Ivy rocked back and forth on her heels.</p>
                   <p>“So can I come sit in your base?” she asked at last.</p>
                   <p>Dylan bit his lip. He looked around, but there was no one except her, looking up at him with her big round eyes and serious expression.</p>
                   <p>“I guess so,” he gave in. “But you can’t touch the rock.”</p>
                   <p>“That’s what I normally sit on.”</p>
                   <p>“Oh.”</p>
                   <p>If she was sat on the rock, Dylan reasoned, no one could take it. Probably not even Fred could lift the rock if a girl was sat on it. Even a small one from across the river. Really, he was just doing his job if he let her in. She wasn’t playing with them, so it wasn’t like it mattered.</p>
                   <p>“Alright, then.” He motioned her past him with a conspiratorial nod.</p>
                   <p>The game carried on in the distance. Dylan dug his hands into his pockets and leant against the tree to wait. Every so often he snuck a glance over his shoulder, keeping a close eye on the witch’s daughter as she read her book of spells.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>“You’ll miss your tea, boy,” said Mrs Hayes from her front doorway. “Your mother’ll go spare.”</p>
                   <p>“SorryMrsHayes,” Dylan said in one breath, lowering his head and pumping his arms furiously as he scuttled home.</p>
                   <p>He hurried past the familiar stone cottages with their carefully pruned gardens, up onto the high street and through the market square. He rounded the corner at the butcher's shop, almost colliding with Mrs Richardson coming the other way.</p>
                   <p>“Evening, Dylan,” she said. “How’s your mother?”</p>
                   <p>“FineMrsRichardson,” he told her, jogging backwards as he spoke to her. His father worked for her husband.</p>
                   <p>“Hurry along, young man,” she waved him away.</p>
                   <p>“GoodbyeMrsRichardson!”</p>
                   <p>He turned and skipped his way into a full canter. Curtains twitched as he ran past. The sun was quickly disappearing behind the church spire. He could see his house now, his mother stood at the gate tapping her foot, apron still tied around her waist.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>It wasn’t pirates the following week. Everyone still wanted to play Kings. Someone had borrowed their mother's mop so they could try jousting, but it had been a bit one-sided, what with only the one mop. After a while, Dylan had grown bored and wandered off. No one seemed to notice.</p>
                   <p>He found himself coming by the hollow without knowing why. Ivy was there, head stuck in a book.</p>
                   <p>“Whatcha reading?” he asked.</p>
                   <p>“A book,” she said, then noticed that he seemed to be expecting more from her. “It’s about a boy on a desert island.”</p>
                   <p>“I thought you said they were spellbooks?”</p>
                   <p>“Oh, they’re magic alright. You can go anywhere with a book. Anywhere at all, without moving.”</p>
                   <p>That did sound like witchcraft.</p>
                   <p>“Are there pirates?” he asked.</p>
                   <p>“I don’t know,” she said. “I haven’t finished it yet.”</p>
                   <p>“Mind if I sit with you?”</p>
                   <p>Ivy shrugged. He peered over her shoulder until eventually she sighed and passed the book over to show him the pictures. Palm trees and beaches. And pirates. Witch’s books have pirates.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>Some of the boys were going to go up to the cottage on the hill. It was for a dare. Someone’s brother had seen all kinds of terrifying things in there — bubbling cauldrons and demon statues with glowing red eyes and severed hands wrapped in spiders webs. Ivy’s mother was a black widow, and she worshipped the devil. They were going to take eggs to throw at the windows.</p>
                   <p>Dylan thought it all sounded quite unlikely. Ivy seemed quite nice, for a witch’s daughter. It wasn’t as though they were hurting anyone. He told them what he thought about the whole thing.</p>
                   <p>He went home with a black eye. He never told his parents who did it, but everyone in the village knew.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>“Been anywhere good?”</p>
                   <p>Ivy looked up from her book, her face as unreadable as ever. He came here every day after school now. That was where she usually was. Some of the boys had tried to tell her that she couldn’t have a spot in the forest, that it wasn’t her forest to have, but Dylan had seen them off. He wasn’t talking to Fred anymore.</p>
                   <p>“To the moon,” she said. “And then a thousand leagues under the sea.”</p>
                   <p>“So where next?”</p>
                   <p>“Verona,” she said. “You won’t like this one.”</p>
                   <p>“Oh.” He scratched his head. “What happened to the one about the giant? You were just getting to the good part.”</p>
                   <p>“I threw it away,” said Ivy, turning the page.</p>
                   <p>“Why?”</p>
                   <p>She sighed. Closed the book.</p>
                   <p>“It got muddy. Fell apart.”</p>
                   <p>“Who did it?” he asked, fists balling as he rose to his feet.</p>
                   <p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>
                   <p>“It does. I’ll fight them for you.”</p>
                   <p>She stood in front of him, pushed his arms back down to his sides.</p>
                   <p>“There’s no point fighting,” she said. “It won’t change their minds.”</p>
                   <p>She met his stare. There was a fierce calm there. If the village had eyes, they would look like that. Unyielding. Unmoving. All-knowing. Dylan looked away first.</p>
                   <p>“Aren’t you lonely?” he asked.</p>
                   <p>“No.” She looked confused. “You’re here.”</p>
                   <p>And then he bent down and planted his lips on her cheek, just for a second. Ivy blushed, pressed a hand to her cheek.</p>
                   <p>The witch’s daughter smiled.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>Dylan felt the stares as he walked back through the village. Old Mrs Hayes sat in her doorway as always, rocking on her chair as she knitted, surveying her street. Her father had lived in that house, and his father before his, back as far as anyone could remember. She would die in that house.</p>
                   <p>“Evening, boy,” she said.</p>
                   <p>He could feel her eyes on him, as though she could see Ivy on his hands and on his lips. He mumbled some reply, turning red as he spoke.</p>
                   <p>“Strange child,” she said, though he could still hear her. Half the village probably heard. “He’d do well to stay away from that one.”</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>Ivy moved away a few months later. Her mother had given in to the other adults’ barely concealed contempt and taken a job somewhere else. No one would tell him where.</p>
                   <p>Ivy was right — you couldn’t fight the village. Her mother had lived here for eight years, Ivy’s whole lifetime. She had tried resolutely to plant her roots, but the earth here was poison to newcomers, too full of ancient roots that stretched back for a hundred years without ever touching the outside world. No one understood where Ivy’s mother had come from or the life she had had, and no one cared to find out either. They weren’t from around here. Ivy’s family was different and that was that. Ivy had shown him the world, and now she had gone out into it, the only place she could belong.</p>
                   <p>Eventually, he stopped going to the hollow to see if she had somehow come back, returned to the other boys. People started smiling at him again when he walked down the street, but they didn’t look as friendly any more. What once had been comforting now seemed stifling. They knew every inch of him, every secret. They couldn’t bear not knowing someone, of not having the clout to tell someone who they ought to be.</p>
                   <p>Within a few weeks, his friends had forgotten the summer he had spent with Ivy and all was forgiven. They played cops and robbers, and cowboys and Indians, but it wasn’t the same.</p>
                   <p>Nothing was ever quite the same.</p>

                <h2>Unpaving Paradise</h2>
                <h3>Ruth Midgley</h3>
                <div class="text">
                   <p>Imagine how hard it is to break up asphalt with a pickaxe. Now imagine it's not even a very good pickaxe. And you've been doing it for days. The sun, hotter now, makes the sweat bead on your face, itchy like a bug landing on you. Sometimes enough water escapes your pores to form a little stream that carves a path down the black dust on your face. And it tortures you that your body is letting such a precious resource just drip onto the ground. Unretrievable.</p>
                   <p>This has been my existence for almost a full moon. Me, my pickaxe, and the pavement. My hands have carved grooves into the handle as the handle has chiseled callouses onto my hands. I worry my arms won't know how to do anything else by the time I get to stop. Will they remember how to hug? How to hold?</p>
                   <p>I don't want to tell you how much more asphalt there is to go.</p>
                   <p>Sometimes, I get to use a shovel to heave the crumbles of concrete into the circulating wheelbarrow. It comes past my plot every hour or so. They say a change is as good as a break. I would like to state for the record that it depends on the degree of change.</p>
                   <p>They didn't have a plan for removing the concrete jungle, the people who poured it out and put it up. It always grew bigger, never smaller. Engineers only thought about how to lay it down, not about who was going to have to pick it back up. That’s my job now. To rip it up to reveal the earth underneath, all pale and wrinkly like skin under a cast that has been on too long. And if they had thought about it, they would never have imagined doing it with a pickaxe.</p>
                   <p>They didn't have a plan for any of it. If they had, I wouldn't be here.</p>
                   <p>I can stop at any time. This isn't a prison sentence. It's more like penance. No, that’s not quite right because it’s not my sin I am trying to atone for. More like a damage deposit for my existence. For everything that I will take, I must first give something.</p>
                   <p>I see my fellow pilgrims scattered across the hot mirage of black flatness, multicolored spray-painted lines designating each person’s plot. Some have left their posts and are sitting in the shade of the trees by the roadside or have gone into the Mall to lie down on their mats. But I turn back to my pickaxe. It helps to imagine the sweat on my back as if it was cool grass or the wet wall of a dark cave.</p>
                   <p>I don’t join them. I don’t rest. I'm on a time limit. It’s hard to know when my time will be up, when the biological clock that is on the Mainland will run out.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>Now I’m working by the full moon and there are no clouds. Enough light to work in the blessedly cool darkness. I have to take advantage of these nights so I haven’t slept in two days.</p>
                   <p>Every time I put down my pickaxe, I feel the fear. The fear that I won’t finish in time. That I’ll be so close but that it will be too late. I imagine being able to see the finish line and then getting word that it’s too late. And that the finish line has moved or disappeared. And if I’d only kept going and not took that break, if I’d swung a little harder, shoveled a little faster, I would have made it. And our lives could have begun.</p>
                   <p>So, I pick up the pickaxe. Lift it and let it fall. I have to sleep soon.</p>
                   <p>My plot is bigger than most since I’m unpaving for two. “This is how it starts," my wife told me when I volunteered to unpave for both of us. “This is how patriarchy restarts. I can do it with you. Women can -”</p>
                   <p>I put my hand on her arm. “Plenty of women unpave. You know this isn’t about that.”</p>
                   <p>“It is always about that.”</p>
                   <p>“It’s not worth it. If something were to happen… It’s not worth it.”</p>
                   <p>“I know...”</p>
                   <p>We had made it to the Coast a few days before. Between bike repairs, scavenging for food, and avoiding bike gangs as often as wild animals, it had taken us longer than we thought. We set out from the Prairies as soon as we estimated there wouldn’t be any threat of snow in the passes. It was not an inevitability that we would make it. I imagine the people in the Before and how certain they could be that they would make it to their destination. They probably didn’t even think about it. We were constantly reminded by the shapes of bicycle skeletons, abandoned by the roadside. God only knows where the skeletons of the riders are now.</p>
                   <p>But it had been more certain that we would die if we spent another frigid winter on the Prairies. It was clear when we got there that we weren’t the only ones to risk a dangerous journey with the hope of ending up somewhere better. People had been waiting so long to cross, a small village had erected itself in the ferry terminal.</p>
                   <p>By the time it was our turn, my wife had already told me the news. She would try to keep it secret for as long as possible but we decided I would have to cross alone.</p>
                   <p>And so now I am here and she is there, with a sea between us until I finish.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>I shovel chunks of the scar I have unstuck from the Earth into the wheelbarrow. The young girl who is pushing the cart today smiles at me and says, “The Earth thanks you,” as she moves away. She must be new. It’s what people say to each other here in the Parking Lot. It’s supposed to be encouraging, to remind us that this is a great service. But it just sounds like words to me now.</p>
                   <p>You don’t realize how much concrete there is until you need to grow your own food. When there aren’t any cars to park on it, the black flatness looks so impotent.</p>
                   <p>The monks who run this Parking Lot and Mall, which is now their church and where the pilgrims sleep, sometimes walk the plots to preach to us.</p>
                   <p>“As we break open the asphalt and renew the crust of the Earth, so too shall we renew ourselves and be found worthy.”</p>
                   <p>They’re keeping the useful pavement of course. The roads and the bike paths. More practical minds will only let their unpaving crusade go so far.</p>
                   <p>“Like weeds through the cracks of asphalt we will persevere and you will be born again into this new world, this Paradise.”</p>
                   <p>They often remind us about the Paradise. This Island where people don’t go hungry. The Island where the homes can heat themselves. The Island where no one fights over the scraps of the Before. The Island where there is enough. And we, the lucky ones, will be able to be part of it. We will be given a bicycle and a home and a plot of arable land. And safety.</p>
                   <p>We just need to break up some concrete first. It’s only fair.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>I’ve had a setback. I woke up inside the Mall, my head splitting. Apparently, I collapsed from dehydration. The monks say they will only let me work for so many hours a day now. They don’t want a death on their conscience.</p>
                   <p>They won’t let us out of the Lot so I am stuck pacing the perimeter. I don’t know what to do with all the extra time. It’s time I don’t want to be spending. I can’t afford it.</p>
                   <p>I ask newcomers if there is any news from the Mainland. My wife said she would try to send letters with pilgrims who cross. There is never any news. I hope she’s still alive.</p>
                   <p>***</p>
                   <p>I am close now. The resting may have actually done me good and I am making progress. I plead with the monks to let me work more of the day. I contemplate sneaking out at night but can’t risk censure. I can’t be sent back when I’m this close to finishing my plot. I can taste more than just the dust of the asphalt now. I can taste the Paradise, it’s so close to being ours. I can taste my wife. I fantasize about her lips and her skin and her belly, almost not seeing the black pavement I’m ripping up, just feeling my arms lift and lower as my eyes see only her face. Up and down, up and down, up and down. Day after, day after, day after -</p>
                   <p>“Hey, woah there, stop for a minute. STOP!”</p>
                   <p>I realize there is a monk standing beside my plot.</p>
                   <p>“You have a wife on the Mainland, right?”</p>
                   <p>I blink stupidly at her, trying to clear the sweat and my wife from my eyes. Finally, I nod.</p>
                   <p>“She’s had a baby.” The monk says flatly. It is not a congratulation.</p>
                   <p>My pickaxe falls as my knees crunch into the pavement. I wasn’t fast enough. I didn’t make it.</p> 
                   <p>“Is she alright?” I search her eyes.</p>
                   <p>“She’s still alive and the baby is too.”</p>
                   <p>She looks at the small square of unbroken asphalt that is all that is left of my plot. She takes a can of spray paint out of her pocket and shakes it.</p>
                   <p>“Babies are expensive for the Earth, you know.”</p>
                   <p>I watch as she draws a new line around me. It is impossibly large. She caps the bottle, touches my shoulder, and says, “The Earth thanks you.” She starts to walk away.</p>
                   <p>I stare at the pavement around me, unbelieving. My arms feel full of gravel.</p>
                   <p>“Wait!” I feel myself cry out, staggering to my feet. “Is it a boy or a girl?”</p>
                   <p>The monk looks back at me as if it’s a silly question and I’m not sure she is going to answer.</p>
                   <p>“A girl.”</p>
                   <p>I have a daughter. I have a daughter and she deserves Paradise.</p>
                   <p>I pick up my pickaxe.</p>

                <h2>Golden Cheekbones and the Rising Sun</h2>
                <h3>Molly Quinnell</h3>
                <div class="text">
                   <p>I open my eyes.</p>
                   <p>I am readying myself for the morning.</p>
                   <p>A golden cheekbone lined by the rising sun, beautiful in its simplicity. I touch it, once, her skin warm under my fingers, a reminder of how alive we are. How young we are.</p>
                   <p>We are teenagers. Our hands are clumsy, too big for our skinny limbs, not sure where to go or what to think. These hands hold pens, and books, and dreams. We discuss the future in vivid colours, full of blossoming hope of what it could hold. Neither of us say it, our lips tied by the thin string of fear, but our dreams involve each other. Neither of us knows what love means, our kisses fuelled by wandering hands and inexperienced tongues, but I know the lines of her face better than I know the words of my textbook. Neither of us knows anything, but we know each other.</p>
                   <p>We grow, as all things do, messily, with anger and lust and tears. She holds the neck of a bottle of beer, her head titled back, laughing into the night, her cheeks flushed. She is brighter than any star, and I wonder if I could replicate the jewels in her eyes, and make them into a jewel for her finger. I smile, small, and take another sip. I know that she is the one.</p>
                   <p>Our wedding is small, but loud, screams of joy echoing from every lively corner. Her mother gives me a talk, my mother gives me a heart attack. All I can feel is the creases of her hand enveloped in mine, and the sweet press of her lips on my face. I do.</p>
                   <p>"You do nothing!" She screams at me, waving at the dirty dishes lining every corner of our rotting kitchen. She is tired. I am tired. We both know it is not each other we are angry at, but the bank, the debt, the crushing weight of the tiny house. I bite my cheek. It is both my fault, and hers, and neither.</p>
                   <p>She still crawls into our bed, and hugs me tight. I still make her coffee in the morning. It is a test, and we have passed.</p>
                   <p>The first one is a surprise, with delighted screams and happy tears at the start, and terrible screams and pain filled tears at the end. But she is alive, and our child is alive, and they both nestle deep into the lining of my heart and refuse to let go. Surely my heart will run out of space for any more love.</p>
                   <p>I was wrong. We have two more, and it still makes room.</p>
                   <p>The children grow fast, faster than we ever did. They are sickly sweet when young, chubby cheeks and grotty hands, always reaching for something more. A little older, and they're cheeky, and quiet, and confused. A little older, and they're angsty, quiet, and polite. A little older still and they're angsty, angsty, and quiet.</p>
                   <p>Then comes the dreaded stage. Angsty, angsty and angsty. Teenagers.</p>
                   <p>A little older, and it's going, angsty, and angsty. Then gone, going and angsty. Then gone, gone, and going.</p>
                   <p>It's not long before the last kisses us both on the forehead and thanks us for the privilege of receiving our love. I hold her hands. "Love is not a privilege," I say, "it is a necessity."</p>
                   <p>She smiles, and thanks us anyway. She was always far too polite.</p>
                   <p>We move into a smaller house. Cozy, not cramped. It brings back memories of our first place. "Don't talk about that!" she says, "that place was awful!" She smiles more now, and fills her days reading books and making bread. I kiss her neck as she makes cookies, and she playfully pushes me away. She thinks I only want chocolate, but her love is the sweetest thing in our kitchen.</p>
                   <p>She takes up knitting, and I joke that she's getting old. She pretends to disagree, but we both know I'm right. My knees scream every time I bend to remove a weed from our growing garden.</p>
                   <p>She gets sick.</p>
                   <p>She survives.</p>
                   <p>I get sick.</p>
                   <p>I survive.</p>
                   <p>She has glasses now, small and oval shaped, perched on the top of her nose. The kids in the neighbourhood call us "Gran and Pops." Apparently, according to our son, we have a "reputation." I disagree, of course. The only reason she makes cookies for the school children is so they don't drive their chunky bikes through my nice flowers. So what if I help them fix their punctured tyres? So what if she makes them fresh lemonade? So what if we told them "just ask him on a date, he told me he liked you the other day"? That doesn't mean we like the buggers.</p>
                   <p>The young men flirt with her, as a joke. They say she's the most beautiful thing they've ever seen. I growl at them, of course, but only because they're right.</p>
                   <p>Our faces are lined with wrinkles now, and my hearing is half gone. She's stooped now, hunched and pinched, yet every time she smiles we go back to being young, with those jewels in her eyes, and I fall in love all over again. We don't go out to the kids anymore. They come to us, and a young man helps her make the cookies when her hands shake, and a young woman helps me with the weeds when my knees give. I hear on the news every day about the new generation being lazy, and I shake my head every time. These kids are just growing the way all things grow. Messily.</p>
                   <p>I wake up one morning to the sweet sound of birds. I wake up one morning to the smell of fresh grass. I wake up one morning, the sun peeking over the horizon, its gentle limbs stroking our faces from the window.</p>
                   <p>I wake up one morning.</p>
                   <p>She doesn't.</p>
                   <p>A golden cheekbone lined by the rising sun, beautiful in its simplicity. I touch it, once, her skin cold under my fingers. A reminder of how long we had together, how lucky we were.</p>

                   <p>And let myself slip into the night.</p>
